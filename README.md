# Game-of-Life

The Game of Life is a simulation game developed by the mathematician Conway John as a model for studying the life cycle of the living organism. The game is played on a huge matrix whose parts are possible life sites: each site can have one of the following two situations:

A. "Yesh Haim" - a full life site - will be marked as a full square

B. "There is no life" - an empty life site - we will mark it as an empty square


CONWAY'S BASIC LAWS OF GENETICS:

• Birth - in every site where there is "no life" that has exactly 3 living neighbors, there will be a birth in the next generation. Otherwise the site remains "lifeless" - empty.

• Death - at any site where there is "life" that has 0 or 1 living neighbors, death will occur in the next generation as a result of loneliness. In any site where "there is life" and if there are 4 or more living neighbors, death will occur in the next generation as a result of "population explosion".

• Existence - any site where "there is life" and has 2 or 3 living neighbors, will continue to exist in the next generation. The processes of birth, death and existence occur simultaneously in all sites and create a new state of life called a new generation.
